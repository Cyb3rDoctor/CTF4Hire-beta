## Solution:

According to the description, we need to find someone called "Tyler Umbridge" somewhere on the internet...

<br/><br/>

After searching for "Tyler Umbridge" in a lot of social media sites and not finding anything intersting,
I noticed that the name "Tyler Umbridge" is similar to "Tumblr" ðŸ˜‚

<br/><br/>

So, I searched for "Tyler Umbridge" in https://www.tumblr.com/:

**There are some memes in his profile, and the challenge description said that Tyler Umbridge used memes as a covert communication channel.**

And one of his posts was very interesting:
